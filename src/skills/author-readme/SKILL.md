    3. If no logo was found, use an appropriate emoji to replace [LOGO] with `<span style="font-size: 96px; text-shadow: -3px -3px 0 #000, 3px -3px 0 #000, -3px  3px 0 #000, 3px 3px 0 #000, 0 -3px 0 #000, 0 3px 0 #000, -3px 0 0 #000, 3px 0 0 #000;">{emoji}</span>`.

## Rules for Updates

- Use README.md Layout only for a new README or user-requested full rewrite.
- For target update, keep existing README structure.
- Before edit, record hero, logo, H1, badges, header HTML, and section anchors.
- Edit only requested anchors or anchors with factually outdated content.
- Never remove or replace hero, logo, H1, badges, or header HTML in partial update.
- If `autocode_logo_find` failed, preserve existing logo; never remove or substitute it.
- After write, verify recorded hero, logo, H1, badges, header HTML, and unrelated sections are unchanged.
- Remove empty sections without factual content; do not add guessed or "coming soon" content.
- Validate markdown links; update factually outdated information.
- Avoid duplicate content; link to existing sections instead.
- Define non-standard acronyms and terms once at first use.
- Never mention deprecated tools or configs; keep examples current.
